## Introduction

UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can represent any Unicode character. It is widely used in computer systems and programming languages to handle international text.

The purpose of this code is to provide a UTF-8 validation function that can be used to check if a given byte array represents a valid UTF-8 encoded string.

## Usage

To use the UTF-8 validation function, follow these steps:

1. Include the `utf8_validation.py` module in your project.
2. Call the `validate_utf8` function, passing in the byte array to be validated.
3. The function will return `True` if the byte array is a valid UTF-8 encoded string, and `False` otherwise.
